# Qovery Website Redesign (Old Version)

This project is a redesign of the old version of the **Qovery.com** website, created as part of a learning experience. The goal was to replicate the design of the original site while enhancing it with modern web development techniques and different animations.

## Features

- **Sass Integration**: This project was my first experience with **Sass**, and I utilized its features to streamline styling and make the code more maintainable.

- **Basic JavaScript**: Used **JavaScript** to manage certain animations and interactions, adding dynamic behavior to the site.

## Technologies Used
